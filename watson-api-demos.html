          Overview
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          In 2015, Watson launched 15 cognitive services across language, vision, speech and data analytics categories in Watson Developer Platform. Each service had a demonstration application provided along the release. The purpose of API demonstration application is to show general audience the value of Watson service, and the code of the application will be hosted in github to serve as an education material to education developer how to use Watson APIs, and SDK.

        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          As a UX designer, my role is to help product manager figure out the use case, design an interaction flow, and work with engineering team to ship it. I was also responsible for the front-end development as well.

        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          <strong>Define use case. </strong>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            Each service has multiple APIs. How to select MVP set to make a story communicating service's business value is one of the biggest challenges.
          </div>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            We conducted a lot of brainstorming sessions with service team to understand each API, and explored lots of options to identify proper dataset consumable by general audience.

        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          <strong>Speed and consistency. </strong>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            Since we are a small design team(6 designers) facing 15 service teams, we are working in an agency mode to engage each service team in short amount of time to help them release their service. Driving the consistency of styling and interaciton pattern among all the demonstration applications is one of the biggest challenges. While developing the applications, each service engineering team has difference skillsets and difference mature level of application development, how to deliver maintainable code and make them up to speed with standarded code format is another challenge.
          </div>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            In the process, we generated a pattern library with design language translated and a boilerplate with SDK integrated, which helped us solve consistency issues and improve development efficiency.

          <strong>Empower PM and engineers.</strong>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            For a lot of product managers and engineer teams, it was their first time experience working with design. We were trying to show them design is not only good for producing pretty craft, but also a strong thinker for problem solving. I learnt how to facilitate brainstorming session with product managers and engineers to collaborately identify solutions.

            I'm proud of the pattern library and boilerplate we produced in the process. It showed the design's capability to execute, and helped us curate an open sourced collarative environment within design and engineering organization.
