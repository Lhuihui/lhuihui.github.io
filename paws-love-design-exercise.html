            I did some quick interviews with five friends of mine, ranging from no pet experience, having one pet to having mulitple pets to understand their motivation and experience of finding their pet, and how their pet relationship went.

          Define project goals (0.5 hours)
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          After understanding the pet adoption system, and hearing my friends' stories about how they used to make decisions and how that effected the outcome of their pet relationship. I feel like the key problem is <strong>there is not enough data about the pet for adopters to make profound decisions.</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          Based on the shelter staff, their animals are from all over the place. When they got the animals, they didn't know their histories. They can only rely on the staff/volunteers' personal experience with the animals to help adopters to match the right one for them. Unfortunately, volunteers come and go. Most of the animal information didn't get fully transferred.
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          So I think one big part of the solution should be providing an easy <strong>pet information documenting system</strong> to collect as much as data about the pet. Another big part of the solution is to provide adopters <strong>a cognitive personalized pet content platform for pet discovery, matching, recommendation and pet raising education</strong>.

          <li>
            Pet adopters need a way to get a better feel for the animals and have trustworthy information so that they can choose the pet that is the right fit for them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pet adopters need a way to learn pet care expertise so that they feel prepared instead of anxious.
          </li>
          <li>
            Volunteers need an easier, more effective way to share their expertise and provide guidance to potential adopters.
