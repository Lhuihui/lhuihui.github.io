          <strong>Interview (2 hours)</strong>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            I did some quick interviews with five friends of mine, ranging from no pet experience, having one pet to having mulitple pets to understand their motivation and experience of finding their pet, and how their pet relationship went.
          </div>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            Based on the interview data, I created the following two personas:

          Define project goals
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          After understanding the pet adoption system, and hearing my friends' stories about how they used to make decisions and how that effected the outcome of their pet relationship. I feel like the key problem is <strong>there is not enough data about the pet for adopters to make profound decisions.</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          Based on the shelter staff, their animals are from all over the place. When they got the animals, they didn't know their histories. They can only rely on the staff/volunteers' personal experience with the animals to help adopters to match the right one for them. Unfortunately, volunteers come and go. Most of the animal information didn't get fully transferred.
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          So I think one big part of the solution should be providing an easy <strong>pet information documenting system</strong> to collect as much as data about the pet. Another big part of the solution is to provide adopters <strong>a cognitive personalized pet content platform for pet discovery, matching, recommendation and pet raising education</strong>.
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          From user perspective, I defined three MVP <a style="color:#008671;" href="http://evaluo.im/ux-survival-kit.html#needs-statement" target="_blank">"needs statement"</a>:

          <li>
            Volunteers/shelter staff/foster families need a way to easily document the pet's key moment and information so that it can be accessible to potential adopters and help their decision making.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pet adopters(Laura and Kathryn) need a way to easily discover available pets and have trustworthing information so that we can make right decisions based on their needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pet adopters(Laura and Kathryn) need a way to get pet raising education so that they are better prepared to take care of the pet and deal with crisis.

            Considering the environment when volunteers, shelter staff, foster familites are interacting the pets, their mobile phone probably will be the most accessible device at that moment.

            Based on the interviews, some participants mentioned that current pet information are provided in text format, which is very hard to visualize. So in the design, I'm trying to encourage user to create multi-media story assets, like photos and videos. Considering this will increase the content size in the platform which will potentially cause performance issues, I set up rules only <strong>one image or 1 second video</strong> allowed to be added to pet story per time. </div>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
