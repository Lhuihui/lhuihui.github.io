          I had some interesting findings about how shelters were delivering information to potential adopters. The pet information was in the paper hanging on the animal cage. The shelter staff told me most of the pet age, breeds information is based their guess.

          <strong>Interview (2 hours)</strong>

            I did some quick interviews with five friends of mine, ranging from no pet experience, having one pet to having mulitple pets to understand their motivation and experience of finding their pet, and how their pet relationship went.

          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            Based on the interview data, I created the following two personas:

          Define project goals (0.5 hours)
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          After understanding the pet adoption system, and hearing my friends' stories about how they used to make decisions and how that effected the outcome of their pet relationship. I feel like the key problem is <strong>there is not enough data about the pet for adopters to make profound decisions.</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          Based on the shelter staff, their animals are from all over the place. When they got the animals, they didn't know their histories. They can only rely on the staff/volunteers' personal experience with the animals to help adopters to match the right one for them. Unfortunately, volunteers come and go. Most of the animal information didn't get fully transferred.
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          So I think one big part of the solution should be providing an easy <strong>pet information documenting system</strong> to collect as much as data about the pet. Another big part of the solution is to provide adopters <strong>a cognitive personalized pet content platform for pet discovery, matching, recommendation and pet raising education</strong>.

        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          From user perspective, I defined three MVP <a style="color:#008671;" href="http://evaluo.im/ux-survival-kit.html#needs-statement" target="_blank">"needs statement"</a>:

          <li>

          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            Considering the environment when volunteers, shelter staff, foster familites are interacting the pets, their mobile phone probably will be the most accessible device at that moment. And it's better to be able to get access to camera, so I decide to design <strong>a mobile native app which will help volunteers to co-create pet story videos.</strong>.

          <strong>Entry point</strong>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">

          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            Based on the research, current pet information is provided in text format, which is very hard to visualize. So in the design, I'm trying to encourage voluteers/foster families to create pet story in the form of photos and videos.

              Creating 1s frame instead of the whole video will make the pet story video creation process more collaborative.
