            To get a sense of the problem space, I started conducting desktop research to understand pet adoption process, and who are the different players in the ecosystem of pet adoption industry, and how each player is contributing to the pet adoption process.

            After having a big picture of pet adoption ecosystem, I think knowing what's going on at shelters is very important, so I decided to have a field trip in Texas Human Heroes.

          I had some interesting findings about how shelters were delivering information to potential adopters. The pet information was in the paper hanging on the animal cage. I've chatted with shelter staff. They told me most of the pet age, breeds information is based their guess.

          <strong>Interview (2 hours)</strong>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            I did some quick interviews with five friends of mine, ranging from no pet experience, having one pet to having mulitple pets to understand their motivation and experience of finding their pet, and how their pet relationship went.
          </div>
          <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
            Based on the interview data, I created the following two personas:

        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          After understanding the pet adoption system, and hearing my friends' stories about how they used to make decisions and how that effected the outcome of their pet relationship. I feel like the key problem is <strong>there is not enough data about the pet for adopters to make profound decisions.</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          Based on the shelter staff, their animals are from all over the place. When they got the animals, they didn't know their histories. They can only rely on the staff/volunteers' personal experience with the animals to help adopters to match the right one for them. Unfortunately, volunteers come and go. Most of the animal information didn't get fully transferred.
        </div>
        <div class="_guide--case-study-text">
          So I think one big part of the solution should be providing an easy <strong>pet information contribution system</strong> to collect as much as data about the pet. Another big part of the solution is to provide adopters <strong>a cognitive personalized pet content platform for pet discovery, matching, recommendation and pet raising education</strong>.
